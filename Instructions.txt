What Needs to be done:
1. Emergency class extends two classes 911 and Enhanced-911. As mentioned E911 doesn't need to ask for caller information.
(Use the concept of method overriding here)
2. You need to identify the appropriate response unit to dispatch according to the statement provided by caller and then send an appropriate response unit.
3. Show atleast one call of each type.
